HR receive thousand of resume for job requests. 
This creates a hectic and hard situation for them.
The main task is to select resume which match best with the job description so that only those resumes get selected and those people get interviews.
Thus I created a Python Model which with compare thousand of resumes at once and sort the best resume with best matching score.
This will make the work for HR's hundred times easier. 
This work is a showcase of my knowledge and expertise in the field of AI.
